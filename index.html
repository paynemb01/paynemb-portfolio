                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Payne Bailey and I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a degree in Software Engineering. 
                    Game design is one of my passions and something I will always love learning about.
                    <br><br>
                    I've created a few small indie games, web apps, and web pages during the time spent persuring my Bachelor's degree. 
                    Before completion of my degree I've built two computers of my own, and worked on a public mod for a game as well as a game of my own made with friends.
                    I decided to pursue a degree in software engineering so as not to limit myself and it's given me exposure to many different aspects of development.
                    <br><br>
                    In my spare time I play video games, keep up to date with the gaming industry, play Dungeons & Dragons, and learn about anything I find interesting.

                    Hello World is a very basic retro inspired bullet hell. This was my senior project for my capstone game development course.
                    <br><br>
                    This game has a few mechanics in it that took a bit of a struggle to implement, such as complex immunity frames, pathfinding, random spawning, avoiding pop-in, and generally making the game look nice despite it's simple appearance.

                    ClimateCast was a basic web app that I designed with a partner. We created wireframes and prototypes of the website and how it would work to formulate a plan of action when we actually started coding.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first introduction to working with an API and receiving the information from the query then formatting it for the app.

                    This is a webstie I created that is hosted by my college, UNC Charlotte. The point of this website was to introduce me to advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and practicing them through execution.
                    Multiple pages were created, each as part of their own assignment. This also let me get familiar with FTP clinets for website publication.
                    <br><br>
                    This was actally a pretty fun experience but it does not make me fond of working with CSS. Feel free to take a look around as the website is still being hosted.

                    For this project I was working in a group of 4 where we had to break down a large amount of employee data, with over 1000 entries and place it into a MySql database.
                    <br><br>
                    We were given an excel spreadhseet that was the output of a survey completed by many employees at a company. From normalizing the large amount of data, then creating the migration functions that formatted the data, and then considering data integrity and security, we each took on different aspects to optimize this data set.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally we created a presentation and presented our process to the professor in a short powerpoint presentation.
