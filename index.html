                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Payne Bailey and am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. 
                    Game design is one of my passions and something I will always love learning about.
                    <br><br>
                    While in school, I created a few small indie games, web apps, and web pages. When I was 15 I built my first computer, later building an upgraded one when I was 19 and starting college.
                    Before completing my degree, I worked on a public mod for a game as well as a game of my own in collaboration with others.
                    I pursued a degree in software engineering to provide me with exposure to many different aspects of software development.
                    <br><br>
                    In my spare time, I play video games, keep up to date with the gaming industry, play Dungeons & Dragons, and learn about anything I find interesting.

                    Hello World is a very basic retro-inspired bullet hell. This was my senior project for my capstone game development course.
                    <br><br>
                    This game demonstrates a few mechanics that required some trial & error on my part to fully implement, such as complex immunity frames, pathfinding, random spawning, avoiding pop-in, and generally making the game look nice despite its simple appearance.

                    ClimateCast was a basic web app that I designed with a partner. We created wireframes and prototypes of the website thereby formulating a plan of action prior to the start of coding.

                    This was my first introduction to working with an API, receiving the information from the query, and then formatting it for the app.

                    This is a website I created that continues to be hosted by my college, UNC Charlotte. The goal of creating this website was an introduction to advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as practicing them through repeated execution.
                    Multiple pages were created, each as part of an individual assignment. I was also required to get familiar with FTP clients for uploading files to an external server.
                    <br><br>
                    This was a pretty fun experience and gave me a lot of respect for what goes into formatting a website. Please take a look around at the website.

                    For this project, I collaborated with others to break down a large amount of employee data, over 1500 entries, and place it into a MySql database.
                    <br><br>
                    We were given an Excel spreadsheet outputted from a survey completed by employees at a company. 
                    Tasks included normalizing a large amount of data, creating the migration functions that formatted the data, and then considering data integrity and security, we each took on different aspects to optimize this data set.
                    I worked on representing the data in different normalizations as well as writing MySql functions.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, we created a PowerPoint presentation and presented our process to the professor, which she regarded as a perfect example of what she was looking for.
